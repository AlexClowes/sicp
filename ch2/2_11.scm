; This is just busy work. Obviously for each interval there are 3 cases: the
; interval is entirely below zero, entirely above zero, or spans zero. The two
; intervals collectively give 3 * 3 = 9 cases.
; You could find the bounds of each case individually (and use min and max to
; find the bounds when both intervals span 0), but the maths is trivial and I
; have better things to do.
